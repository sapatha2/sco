ABSTRACT={Due to advances in computer hardware and new algorithms, it is now possible to perform highly accurate many-body simulations of realistic materials with all their     intrinsic complications. The success of these simulations leaves us with a conundrum: how do we extract useful physical models and insight from these simulations? In this     article, we present a formal theory of downfolding–extracting an effective Hamiltonian from first-principles calculations. The theory maps the downfolding problem into fitt    ing information derived from wave functions sampled from a low-energy subspace of the full Hilbert space. Since this fitting process most commonly uses reduced density matr    ices, we term it density matrix downfolding (DMD).}

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Although the vast majority of high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} cuprate superconductors are hole-doped, a small family of electron-doped compounds exists. Under investigated until recently, there has been tremendous recent progress in their characterization. A consistent view is being reached on a number of formerly contentious issues, such as their order parameter symmetry, phase diagram, and normal state electronic structure. Many other aspects have been revealed exhibiting both their similarities and differences with the hole-doped compounds. This review summarizes the current experimental status of these materials, with a goal to providing a snapshot of our current understanding of electron-doped cuprates. When possible we put our results in the context of the hole-doped compounds. We attempt to synthesize this information into a consistent view on a number of topics important to both this material class as well as the overall cuprate phenomenology including the phase diagram, the superconducting order parameter symmetry, phase separation, pseudogap effects, the role of competing orders, the spin-density wave mean-field description of the normal state, and electron-phonon coupling.},

abstract = {It has long been a challenge to describe the origin of unconventional superconductivity. The two known examples with high Tc, based on iron and copper, have very different electronic structures, while other materials with similar electronic structure may not show superconductivity at all. In this paper, the authors show that by using high accuracy diffusion Monte Carlo calculations, the unconventional superconductors of both high Tc types form a cluster at intermediate spin-charge coupling. The spin-charge coupling may serve as a normal state marker for unconventional superconductivity, and provides evidence that unconventional superconductivity is due to interaction of charge with local spins in materials.},

With this high accuracy technique, the doped ground state is found to be a spin polaron, in which charge is localized through a strong interaction with the spin. This spin polaron has calculated properties largely similar to the phenomenology of the cuprates, and may be the object which forms the Fermi surface and charge inhomogeneity in these materials. The spin polaron has some unique features that should be visible in X-ray, EELS, and neutron experiments. The results contained in this paper comprise an accurate first principles derived paradigm from which to study superconductivity in the cuprates.},

This paper derives the most general s, p and d orbital Hubbard-like Hamiltonians consistent with the relevant symmetries, and presents them in ways convenient for practical calculations. We use the full configuration interaction method to study p and d orbital dimers and compare results obtained using the correct Hamiltonian and the collinear and vector Stoner Hamiltonians. The Stoner Hamiltonians can fail to describe properly the nature of the ground state, the time evolution of excited states, and the electronic heat capacity.},
