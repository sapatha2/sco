[[47930,1],0]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: golub052

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 3 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD 
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec has exited due to process rank 3 with PID 47109 on
node golub052 exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpiexec (as reported here).
