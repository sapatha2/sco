This directory will have all the DFT fitting data

spin texture, occupied orbitals, E, 1rdm 

Occupied orbitals are from active space taking highest energy dx^2-y^2 orbitals to the virtual dx^2-y^2 virtual bands 
Total energy is built using the DFT total energy + difference in eigenvalues 
1rdm built on IAO basis constructed from CHK x=0 state (lowest energy) using the occupied + (dx^2-y^2 virtual) bands
